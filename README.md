# Shift Registers

Playing with shift registers, Python and Beaglebone Black GPIO to drive a matrix of LEDs! This code is experimental and on the slow side, it will probably be rewritten and replaced with C!

* 16 Lines (1/8 Scan rate)
* 3 Selector bits (A/B/C)
* 2 color bits for selected rows (0/8, 1/9, 2/10)
* Click, Latch and OE

Examples to make patterns, a dancing space invader, etc
